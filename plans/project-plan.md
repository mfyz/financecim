# Financecim - Project Plan

## Overview
A minimal personal finance application for tracking and categorizing transactions from multiple sources.

## Core Objectives
- Import transactions from various financial sources
- Automatically categorize transactions using mapping rules
- Allow manual categorization and transaction management
- Provide clear visibility into spending patterns

## Data Model

### 1. Categories
- **Purpose**: Define spending categories for transaction classification
- **Fields**:
  - id (unique identifier)
  - name (e.g., "Groceries", "Transportation", "Entertainment")
  - parent_category_id (optional, for subcategories)
  - color (for UI visualization)
  - icon (optional)
  - monthlyBudget (optional, decimal for budget tracking)
  - created_at
  - updated_at

### 2. Sources
- **Purpose**: Represent different financial institutions or import sources
- **Fields**:
  - id
  - name (e.g., "Chase Bank", "Capital One")
  - type (bank, credit_card, manual)
  - created_at
  - updated_at

### 3. Auto-Categorization Rules
- **Purpose**: Automatically categorize transactions using dual rule systems
- **Unit Rules**: Assign transactions to business units/entities
  - id
  - rule_type (source, description)
  - pattern (text to match)
  - match_type (contains, starts_with, exact, regex)
  - unit_id (FK to units)
  - priority (for rule precedence)
  - active (boolean)
  - created_at
  - updated_at
- **Category Rules**: Assign transactions to spending categories
  - id
  - rule_type (description, source_category)
  - pattern (text to match)
  - match_type (contains, starts_with, exact, regex)
  - category_id (FK to categories)
  - priority (for rule precedence)
  - active (boolean)
  - created_at
  - updated_at

### 4. Units
- **Purpose**: Top-level categorization for business units/entities (e.g., "Main Business", "Side Hustle", "Personal")
- **Fields**:
  - id
  - name (e.g., "Marketing Agency", "Freelance Design", "Personal")
  - color (for UI visualization)
  - icon (optional)
  - active (boolean)
  - created_at
  - updated_at

### 5. Transactions
- **Purpose**: Core transaction data
- **Fields**:
  - id
  - source_id (FK to sources)
  - unit_id (FK to units, user-editable)
  - date (transaction date)
  - description (transaction description)
  - amount (positive for income, negative for expenses)
  - source_category (original category from source)
  - category_id (FK to categories, user-editable)
  - ignore (boolean, user-editable)
  - notes (text, user-editable)
  - created_at
  - updated_at

### 6. Import Log
- **Purpose**: Track import history and results
- **Fields**:
  - id
  - source_id (FK to sources)
  - import_date (when the import was performed)
  - file_name (optional, for file-based imports)
  - transactions_added (count of new transactions)
  - transactions_skipped (count of duplicates/ignored)
  - transactions_updated (count of updated transactions)
  - status (success, partial, failed)
  - error_message (optional, for failures)
  - metadata (JSON, for additional import details)
  - created_at

## Technology Stack

### Confirmed Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite (local) with Turso/libSQL (remote)

#### 4. Auto-Categorization Rules (Enhanced Dual System)
- **Unit Rules**: Assign transactions to business units/entities
  - Rules list with enable/disable toggle
  - Add/edit rule form with rule type (source, description)
  - Pattern matching with multiple types (contains, starts_with, exact)
  - Unit selection dropdown
  - Priority ordering with drag & drop
- **Category Rules**: Assign transactions to spending categories
  - Rules list with enable/disable toggle  
  - Add/edit rule form with rule type (description, source_category)
  - Pattern matching with multiple types (contains, starts_with, exact)
  - Category selection dropdown
  - Priority ordering with drag & drop
  - Source category fields as text input (not dropdown)

#### 5. Transactions Screen

  - Sortable columns (date, amount, description, category)
  - Filters:
    - Date range picker
    - Unit filter
    - Source filter
    - Category filter
