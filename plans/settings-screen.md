Create a new tab in navbar, settings, use only gear icon.

Screen will be general settings screen.

Create the first section with red box, "Danger Zone" with "Clean Data" button that would expand a checkbox list, asking what to clean, non of them selected by default. Below the checkboxes "Delete" button. Button will have modal confirmation (we laready have a component for this), if user confirms, an api call will be called and it will clean up models/tables that are selected.
